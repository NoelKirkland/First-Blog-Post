### Fight club was started to create a safe place for like-minded individuals to releive the stresses of their everyday lives by beating eachother up.

Fight Club is an exlusive group and we'd like to keep it that way. We have 8 rules which we all must _strictly abide by_ in order to keep our organization safe and free.

## The 8 rules of Fight Club

1. You do not talk about Fight Club.
2. You DO NOT talk about Fight Club.
3. The fight is over once a person yells ''stop'', taps out, or goes limp.
4. Only two guys are involved in a fight.
5. Only one fight occurs at a time.
6. No shirt, no shoes.
7. There is no time allotment associated with the fights. They go on until they end.
8. First timers at the club must fight.

Fight Club has inumerable benifits, but we have compiled a list of some of our favorites.
